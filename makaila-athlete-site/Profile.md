## Personal Statement
Hello Coaches – My name is Makaila Schneider and I am a passionate student-athlete committed to excelling both on the field and in the classroom. I grew up in Chilliwack, BC, where I fell in love with the game of softball and learned the value of hard work early on. As a freshman infielder at Salt Lake Community College, I’ve had the opportunity to compete at a high level and contribute to my team’s success. This past season I worked hard to earn a starting spot, ultimately hitting above .300 and driving in runs in key moments for the Bruins. I take pride in my versatility – having played middle infield and third base, and even outfield when needed – and I embrace every chance to improve my game. Coaches and teammates know me as a very coachable, hard-working, and competitive player who loves to learn and elevate those around me.

Off the field, I carry the same competitive drive into my academics. I was an honors student in high school and continue to prioritize my studies in college. Balancing a rigorous academic load with collegiate athletics has taught me excellent time management and perseverance. I am interested in pursuing studies in health and fitness, as I believe in training smart and constantly pushing my limits physically and mentally. My goal is to transfer to a four-year university after JUCO and make an immediate impact there as well, both as a player and a leader. I am fully committed to doing what it takes – whether it’s extra reps in the batting cage, additional workouts, or hours in the library – to succeed at the next level. I love this sport and every challenge that comes with it. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me, and I hope to bring my determination, skills, and positive attitude to your program in the future.
